# SayAgain

## What is it?
A game that seeks to explore consequential engagement with NPCs through a focus on meaningful conversation, robust ambience and palpable characterization. Taking place over dinner in the family's somber dining room, Say Again? unapologetically embeds the player into the lives of Mom, Dad, and Alex and leaves them the agency to discover, dismiss, or fuel the chaos held clumsily under wraps in this familial dynamic.

## Getting Started

Simply download the project or clone this repo then run the installer file.

### Prerequisites

* Recommended to be played on 1920x1080 Resolution 
* No other prerequisites, the game is self contained.


### Let's take a look

## Code
```
  #region AI_FIELDS
  protected List<string> currentMadeMemories = new List<string>();
  protected List<DialogueObj> responseList = new List<DialogueObj>();
  protected List<DialogueObj> responseListNPC = new List<DialogueObj>();
  protected List<DialogueObj> jankList = new List<DialogueObj>();
  protected List<string> currentMilestones = new List<string>();
  protected List<int> currentTargets = new List<int>();
```
The objects that NPCs select from and respond to the player with. These go through a filter process to see which response is the correct one.


```
public virtual void applyReactionToBlunt(List<string> t) {
    foreach (var c in t) {
        if (string.Equals(c, "mom", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)) {
            Program.getGame().getMom().setSpriteEmotion(Character.spriteEmotion.angry);
        } else if (string.Equals(c, "dad", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)) {
            Program.getGame().getDad().setSpriteEmotion(Character.spriteEmotion.angry);
        } else if (string.Equals(c, "alex", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)) {
            Program.getGame().getAlexis().setSpriteEmotion(Character.spriteEmotion.angry);
        }
    }
}
```
Reacts to a player choice after the program fetches the state of the NPC and how they will react.

## Challenges

* Due to the exponentially increasing amount of speech options generated by branching dialogue the team needed a way to simulate conversation within the constraints of the real world.
* Creating our own game engine was an interesting challenge as well because it enabled the team to design a program specific for the cause as well as consider the scalability and modibility as we kept developing the game.
* Dialogue authoring was difficult because we wanted a flow to conversation, but preserve the unique branching conversation mechanic.

## My thoughts about the project

* Overall I felt it was a great learning experience for game conception to release.
* The repetition of Object Managers to objects really help drill the Object Oriented Design pattern.
* I felt most of the bottlenecks in the project were creative ones limited by the technology of our time. If the team had unlimited memory space then the problem of exponentially branching storylines would only be stopped by our imagination.
