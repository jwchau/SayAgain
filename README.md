# SayAgain

## What is it?
A game that seeks to explore consequential engagement with NPCs through a focus on meaningful conversation, robust ambience and palpable characterization. Taking place over dinner in the family's somber dining room, Say Again? unapologetically embeds the player into the lives of Mom, Dad, and Alex and leaves them the agency to discover, dismiss, or fuel the chaos held clumsily under wraps in this familial dynamic.

## Getting Started

## Challenges

* Due to the exponentially increasing amount of speech options generated by branching dialogue the team needed a way to simulate conversation within the constraints of the real world.
* Creating our own game engine was an interesting challenge as well because it enabled the team to design a program specific for the cause as well as consider the scalability and modibility as we kept developing the game.
* Dialogue authoring was difficult because we wanted a flow to conversation, but preserve the unique branching conversation mechanic.

## My thoughts about the project

* Overall I felt it was a great learning experience for game conception to release.
* The repetition of Object Managers to objects really help drill the Object Oriented Design pattern.
* I felt most of the bottlenecks in the project were creative ones limited by the technology of our time. If the team had unlimited memory space then the problem of exponentially branching storylines would only be stopped by our imagination.
